# Semivariance Estimator for large datasets #

> My first scientific initiation developed during the graduation of statistics under the guidance of professor [Diogo Rossoni](http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/visualizacv.do?metodo=apresentar&id=K4427847A1) with period of validity from Ago/2015 to July/2016. 


## Summary
Classical methods of Geostatistics present certain limitations to deal with large datasets, especially processing capacity limitations. In order to overcame this issue, this project proposed a method of subsamples to compute the semivariance estimates. 
This work also presents a widely revision of the theoretical framework of Geostatistics.
